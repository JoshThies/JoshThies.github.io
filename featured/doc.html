    <h1>Hollow Knight Rescore</h1>

    <p class="title">A rescoring of the "Abyss Climb" from Hollow Knight using Ableton and Adobe Premiere.
        All of the gameplay, sound effects, and background music was composed and edited by Josh Thies.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
        The first step was recording the gameplay. I couldn't fine what I wanted on youtube, so I used
        screen capture and replayed the game all the way up to this point, a scene that can't be replayed
        more than once per save file. I enjoy the game, so it wasn't terribly laborious, but it's funny
        that I had to put in several hours of video gaming for a school project.

        Up next was the sound effects. I used a website called "freesound: for some and recorded some of my own
        to make a sound effect for each part of the gameplay that, to me, would have made a sound in the virtual world.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lastly, I used the OST of Hollow Knight to inspire my own composition which I made on Ableton. I tried my best to
        sync parts of the music with events on screen, and I am especially proud of the arrangement's finale. Using Premiere
        to assemble all of the parts together, the rescoring was complete.
