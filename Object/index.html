        This project was based on a pet peeve. I hate forgetting to brush or floss my teeth before getting into bed, 
        as I usually remember once I'm cozy and no longer want to get up and do that. However, not keeping my teeth
        clean every night makes me feel like a disgusting human being, so I end up begrudgingly turning the lights back on,
        getting out of bed, and angrily tending to my mouth.
        <br>
        <br>
        My way of fixing this problem is simple. I needed to find a way to remind myself of my poor pearly whites (ok maybe yellowish whites)
        before taking off all of my clothes and getting into bed each night. What is something I do before getting into bed?
        Turning out the lights. Bada Bing Bada Boom we have our trigger. If I turn out the lights before cleaning the ol' chompers,
        sound the alarms. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To make this work, I used two sensors. One to track the light levels in the room, and one to detect whether or not the hygienic tool in question had been moved.
        If I turn the lights out after the toothbrush/floss have been moved, no problem. If they haven't, a speaker will buzz, letting me know I should do that before I get into bed.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my first iteration, I encountered some problems. I used a photoresistor to detect the light levels, but this ran into the problem
        of different readings dependent on the voltage in the circuit. When plugged into my computer, I would get values I could see in the serial
        monitor that I could work with to get my desired result. When plugged into a battery, I had no idea what readings I was getting, but they
        weren't the same, so I couldn't write my code accordingly. I also had to hold every to make it work, but that was a much more practical fix.
        <br>
        <br>
        For my second iteration, in addition to a wooden box enclosure that held every component securely, I switched the photoresistor for an ambient
        light sensor. This was a pain to make work, as the documentation and arduino library data was shaky at best, but it did eventually do the trick.
        Along with the ultrasonic sensor and speaker, I now had a battery powered, fully operational hygiene reminder to never let me be cozy but unclean again.
